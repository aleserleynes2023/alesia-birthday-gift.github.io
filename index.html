    Dear Alesia,<br><br>
    From the moment we met, my life has been brighter, warmer, and so much sweeter. What started as a simple friendship turned out to be the most meaningful bond Iâ€™ve ever known. I still remember those early moments, how you made me feel seen, how your presence brought a light into my world that I never knew I needed.<br><br>
    Even during the time we lost touch, not a single day passed that I didnâ€™t think of you. I searched, I waited, and I silently prayed you were safe and happy. And when your message came, my heart came back to life. You were in LA, blooming into the amazing person I always believed you were meant to be.<br><br>
    Catching up with you felt like being gifted a piece of my soul back. We laughed, we shared memories, and for a while, it felt like time stopped just for us. And when you told me you were coming back to the Philippines, I felt hope like never before.<br><br>
    Even though your visit was filled with responsibilities, every message, every tear, every moment we shared meant everything to me. During those final days, I found the courage to thank you for the memories, for always being a part of my story, and I finally confessed my feelings for you. And you liked me back.<br><br>
    From that moment on, our story changed. We went from best friends to lovers. Since then, Iâ€™ve done my best to show you how deeply I love you with my words, my actions, and all the small things in between. Weâ€™ve shared so many kilig moments, warm hugs across the distance, and an understanding that goes beyond anything Iâ€™ve ever felt.<br><br>
    Now here we are, still going strong. And as your birthday approaches, I just want to say this:<br><br>
    Thank you for being my sunshine, my confidant, my peace, and my best friend. You are the love I prayed for, the soul Iâ€™ve missed for so long, and the future I look forward to with all my heart.<br><br>
    Happy Birthday, my love.<br>
    I love you more than words can ever say.<br><br>
    Forever yours,<br>
    Mr. Aleser Lance L. Leynes

[I built this website and recorded my voice on August 1, 2025, at 11:11 P.M. || If the background music is too loud over my voice, you can mute it. ]

I missed the time when I had that joyful and excited feeling while building this birthday gift website just for you, with so many surprises planned. Maybe you still wanted to see some of the artworks I made and hear the voice I once had the one from when everything between us was still okay, when I was genuinely happy. Itâ€™s your birthday and I didnâ€™t wanna throw away the last effort I did for you.

For the past few weeks after what happened, old wounds and traumas have been reopened. I broke silently, crying myself to sleep every night. I waited for you, I still wanted to talk to you even when you ignored me still holding onto hope even when it felt hopeless. But I realized na I really need to be gentle with my heart na. If it keeps hurting and killing me silently, I canâ€™t keep walking in this endless cycle of breaking and feeling worthless, not while Iâ€™m still building my life and future. I canâ€™t keep holding on and hurting, I do need to let go. Days went by, Iâ€™ve cried enough and I already felt myself changing. Iâ€™m starting to miss the old me. Something in me changed, you can say Iâ€™ve turned cold but Iâ€™m not cruel.

You know, the truth is, itâ€™s been hard for me to really let go because my heart canâ€™t imagine me being with another person because youâ€™re the only one Iâ€™ve ever truly loved this way. You are my first love, the first girl I have ever loved this deeply and genuinely. It doesnâ€™t matter what you looked like, because I already fell in love with your soul. But things happened, you did things, it made me question myself, and now Iâ€™ve been through a lot of pain again.

Still, I forgive you. I wonâ€™t unfollow or unfriend you in any of my socials, we still had good memories as friends, itâ€™s up to you if you want to remove me na, I donâ€™t really mind anymore. Deep down, I know you didnâ€™t mean the things you did or said. Despite everything, Iâ€™m choosing myself again. Iâ€™ve been doing good myself, Iâ€™ve been happier healing alone. I hope youâ€™ve also been doing good. Itâ€™s time I move forward, until love comes at the right time when the Lord marks me ready for the one who truly deserves my genuine love. 

Happy Birthday again, and thank you for everything.
